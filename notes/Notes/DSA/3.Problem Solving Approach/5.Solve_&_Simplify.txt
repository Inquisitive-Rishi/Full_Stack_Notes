After we've broken down our problem and know(..sort of) the steps to solve it.

It's time to solve/simplify the problem.

What does simplify means?

SOLVE THE PROBLEM...! 
if we can't...
SOLVE A SIMPLER PROBLEM...!

Steps to simplify:

- Find the core difficulty in what we're trying to do.
- Temporarily ignore that difficulty.
- Write a simplified solution.
- Then incorporate that difficulty back in.

eg: try this!

    Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string.
