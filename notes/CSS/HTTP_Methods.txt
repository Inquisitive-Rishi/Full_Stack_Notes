When the client communicates with the server, it needs to indicate 
what kind of action that it expects the server to take on behalf of that.

This particular request to the server is called HTTP request method / HTTP Verbs

Different HTTP methods available for us:

- GET PUT POST DELETE PATCH

also, 

- HEAD CONNECT OPTION TRACE

we'll discuss first five for now.

eg:

I've an E-commerce store and i've a list of products 
and the URL is referring to the first product eg url: api/products/p1

- If I'm sending an GET request to this particular URL, I'm telling the server
  that i need the resoure at this particular URL.

  Then the server fetches it and returns it to client.

- PUT request is used to update the resource on the server.

- POST request is used to create data on that resource on the server.

- DELETE request is used to delete data at that resource

- PATCH request the server to partially update the data at the resource.
