This folder 'Problem solving approach' is section 1 of 2 sections on problem solving:

Section 1 & 2 objectives:

- Define what an algorithm is?
- Devise a plan to solve algorithm.
- Section 2 - Covers specific approaches(frequency counter, two pointer problem, divide and conquer)
              to problem solving. 


SOOOO..... What is an algorithm?

Algorithms are 'process' or 'set of steps' to accomplish a certain task.

Why do i even want to learn this?

- Almost everything that we do in programming involves some kind of algorithm.
- It's the 'foundation' for being a successful problem solver and a developer.
- Too important for interviews.

How will you improve?

1. Devise a plan for solving problems.
2. Master common problem solving patterns.

Steps to solve a problem:

- Understand the problem.
- Explore concrete examples.
- Break it down.
- Solve / Simplify.
- Look back and refactor.

We'll discuss each step in detail now.
