Some important Array methods:

Array.filter()
Array.map()
Array.sort()
Array.reduce()


1. Array.filter():

const persons = [
      { first: 'Albert', last: 'Einstein', year: 1879, passed: 1955 },
      { first: 'Isaac', last: 'Newton', year: 1643, passed: 1727 },
      { first: 'Galileo', last: 'Galilei', year: 1564, passed: 1642 },
      { first: 'Marie', last: 'Curie', year: 1867, passed: 1934 },
]

Q. Filter the person(s) born in 1500s.

const filtered = persons.filter(a => a.year >= 1500 && a.year < 1600);
console.log(filtered) 
// { first: 'Galileo', last: 'Galilei', year: 1564, passed: 1642 }

filter method uses a function that  loops over the entire persons array and returns boolean.
if the function returns true for elements in array, that element is filtered out inside a new array.


2. Array.map():

map() function takes in an array, does something with that array and returns a new array.

map is like a machine that takes in a raw material and gives out a totally new product.

Difference b/w map and filter is that map always returns the same amount of item as it receives
i.e the length of input array is same as length of output array.    


3. Array.sort();

sort() function uses a function with two variables and sort the array using these two variables.

eg: const sorted = inventors.sort((a,b)=> a.year > b.year ? 1 : -1);

this method sorts every element (smallest to largest) from an array.
