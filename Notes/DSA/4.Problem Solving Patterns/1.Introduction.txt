Two sections go hand in hand:

1. Problem solving approach (last section).
2. Problem solving patterns (this section).

So we discussed problem solving approach in detail, now we'll discuss 
how to master problem solving patterns.

What are problem patterns?

A pattern tells us what type of problem it is.

Some common problem patterns:
- Frequency counter
- Multiple pointers.
- Sliding window.
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking
- etc etc....

So by looking at a problem, we can deduce the pattern of the problem.
eg: this is a sliding window pattern problem.
    this is a Backtracking pattern problem.
