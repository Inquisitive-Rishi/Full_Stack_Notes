From the last chapter, we now know how to understand the problem:

Now, we'll see how to create concrete examples.

Coming up with examples can help us understand the problem better.

Examples also provides 'sanity checks' that your eventual solution works how it should.
This applies on a larger scale (unit testing / user stories).

Steps to exploring examples:
1. Start with simple examples.
2. Progress to more complex examples.
3. Explore examples with empty inputs.
4. Explore examples with invalid inputs.

point 3 & 4 are more 'edge case' specific.

eg: Write a function which takes in a string and return counts of each character in the string.

1. Start with simple examples.

charCount('aaaa') // {a:4};
charCount('hello') // {h:1, e:1, l:2, o:1}

2. Progress to more complex examples.

'my phone number is 142553534' 
'Hello Dear'

Ask these questions:
- What to output in case of numbers / uppercase?

3. Explore examples with empty inputs.

charCount('') 

Ask these questions:
- Should I return empty string / null / undefined 

4. Explore examples with invalid inputs.

charCount(2324) 

Ask these questions:
- What should be done in case of invalid inputs like numbers.
