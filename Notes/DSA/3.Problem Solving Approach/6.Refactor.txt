Congrats on solving the problem...:)

But we might want to 'LOOK BACK AND REFACTOR' the code.

Questions to ask while refactoring:

- Can you check the results?
  to know if the code works.

- Can you derive the results differently?

- Can i understand the code at a glance?

- Can i use the result or method for some other problem?
  Sometime, while solving the problem, we realize that the same method could be used 
  to solve some other problem that we solved earlier.

- Can i improve the performance of the solution? 
  This is the top priority of every programmer to make the code more efficient.

- Can i think of other ways to refactor the code?

- How have other people solved the problem?
