Now we know how to understand the problem and how to explore eoncrete examples.

We'll see how to break down a problem into smaller chunks:

Breaking down a problem involves:

- Write down the steps we need to take.
    -This forces us to think about the code we'll write before writing it.
     It helps us catch any lingering conceptal issues or misunderstanding before
     we dive in and worry about the details
     eg: (language syntax as well)


Eg: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string.

Steps:

1. Write the steps in simple words (pseudocode).

function charCount(str) {
   // make object to return at end.
   // loop over string for each character...
      // if character is number/letter AND is a key in object, add one to count.
      // if character is number/letter AND not in object, add it to the object and set value to 1.
      // if character is something else (space,period,etc) don't do anything.
   // return object at the end.
}

eg: let str = "Your PIN no is 22455141"
    {
        y : 1,
        o : 2,
        u : 1,
        p : 1,
        i : 2,
        ........etc.
    }
