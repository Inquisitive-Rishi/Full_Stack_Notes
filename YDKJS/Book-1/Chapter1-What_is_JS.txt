JS is a broad and sophisticated language with many features and capabilities

But, JS is founded on three foundational pillars:
1. Scope / Closures
2. Prototypes / Objects
3. Types / Coercion

The official name of JS specified by TC39 is ECMAScript

TC39? --> It is the technical steering committee that manages official specification for the
          language
          They regularly meet to vote on agreed changes which they then submit to ECMA
          ECMA --> It's the standard organisation.

TC39 committee is comprised of 50-100 people from different web-invested companies

such as browser makers (google, mozilla, apple) and device makers (samsung etc)

All members are volunteers and receive compensation for their duties.

TC39 members meets every month, usually for about three days to review work done by members
sincce the last meeting, discuss issues and vote on proposals. 

Meeting locations rotate among member companies willing to host.

All TC39 proposals go through 5 stage process (stage0 - stage4)

Once a proposal reaches stage4 status, it is eligible to be included in the next yearly revision
of the language

It can take from few months to a few years for a proposal to work its way through these stages.

All proposals are managed in the open, on Github repository - https://github.com/tc39/proposals


THE WEB RULES EVERYTHING ABOUT JS:

While the environment that runs JS is expanding (from browsers to servers (nodeJS), to robots,
to lightbulbs, to ...). The one environment that rules JS is the web. 

For most parts, JS defined in the specification and the JS that runs in the browser-based JS
engines is the same. 

But there are some differences that needs to be considered.
