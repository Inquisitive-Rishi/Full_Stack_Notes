Everything in JS happens inside 'Execution Context'.

Execution Context is like a box where everything happens.

EC is made of two parts:

1. Memory Component aka Variable Envirnoment.
2. Code Component aka Thread of Execution.

Memory Component is the place where variables and functions are stored in the form of 
key:value pair.

Code Component is where all the code executes 'line by line'.
i.e second line gets executed only after the 1st line.


JS is a 'Synchronous Single-Threaded Language'
