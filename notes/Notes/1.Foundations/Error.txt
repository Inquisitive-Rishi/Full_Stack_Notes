Three types of errors:

Syntax Error:
1.SyntaxError : shows on invalid syntax of code.

Logic Error: When syntax is correct, code may be wrong.
2.ReferenceErrror : When referenced variables are not found in the code.
3.TypeError : Usually occurs when the function is incompatible with the 
              type of function applied.


Logic errors are harder to fix than syntax errors, as they don't 
directly direct us to the source of the error.
