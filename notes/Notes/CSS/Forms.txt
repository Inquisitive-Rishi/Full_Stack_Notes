There are many different types of form input 'types' which users enter into.

these are:

text - used to enter only text
email - used to enter only email
password - used to enter only password
number - used to enter only numbers.
date - creates a custom date picker for users to choose from
radio - create button/s to choose from (only one at a time)
checkbox - create checkboxes (can have multiple selected)
range - create slider

These are all done under form element tag.
This tag is just like div tag but for form elements.

after/before every 'input' tag there must be a 'label' element tag to 
link with the text field of the forms.

'select' element tag is used to select from multiple options using dropdown.
'option' tag is used within the 'select' tag.
there can be multiple option tags depending on the no:of options we want the users to choose.


There are three types of buttons:

1. Submit button - submits the form to the server.
2. Reset button. - resets the entire form content.
3. General button (anything we want using JS).


when we leave button type undefined, it defaults back to submit button.
It's recommended to specify all our button type to avoid unnecessary issue.


fieldset is used to organize the form contents into different sections.
i.e every section must be covered under fieldset tag.

just under the fieldset tag, we use 'legend' tag to title each of our section 
within the form.
