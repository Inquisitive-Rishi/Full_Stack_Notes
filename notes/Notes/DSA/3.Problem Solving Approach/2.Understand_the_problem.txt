This is the first step in successfully solving a problem.

Understanding a problem means:

1. Can i restate the problems in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that goes into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come out of the problem?
4. Can the output be determined from the inputs?
    that means:
        - Do I have enough information to solve the problem?
            We may not be able to answer the question until we start 
            solving the problem
            but, it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?


eg: Write a function that takes two numbers and return their sum.

1. Can i restate the problems in my own words?
    - 'implement sum of two numbers' or 'add two numbers'

2. What are the inputs that goes into the problem?
    - inputs maybe long integers / strings / floating numbers
    - all of them needed to handled differently and depends on the language we're working.

3. What are the outputs that should come out of the problem?
    - int/float/string.

4. Can the output be determined from the inputs?

5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
    - sum for function name
    - num1 and num2 for variables 
    etc.


Once we start getting into more complicated questions, keeping these 5 steps in mind really help.
